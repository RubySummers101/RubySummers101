# Hi, I’m Bren 👋  
**Cybersecurity Director | AI in Healthcare | Ethical Innovation | Veteran**

Welcome to my GitHub. I bring 18+ years of experience leading cybersecurity, IT, and risk mitigation initiatives across military and mission-critical environments. My work bridges the gap between **technical execution** and **strategic leadership**, with a growing focus on **AI-driven healthcare security** and **early intervention systems** that prevent failure before it happens.

## 🔐 What I Do

- **Cybersecurity Leadership** – Securing enterprise systems, reducing risk, and leading high-performance teams.
- **AI in Healthcare** – Applying ethical AI to improve medical diagnostics and patient outcomes.
- **Data-Driven Insight** – Leveraging data analytics to identify patterns, improve decisions, and streamline operations.
- **System Integrity & Resilience** – Building solutions that work in real-world, high-stakes environments.
