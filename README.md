# Hi, I’m Bren 👋  
**Principal Systems Architect (Space) | Cyber Resilience Leader | Human-Centered Mission Design**

Welcome to my GitHub. I bring 19 years of experience leading cybersecurity, IT, and systems integration efforts across classified, mission-critical environments. I specialize in designing resilient architectures for **space systems**, with a focus on integrating cyber-secure, data-informed solutions that support both the **technical demands of on-orbit operations** and the **human requirements for long-duration mission success**.

My current work centers on **multi-domain systems design**, **architecture modeling**, and **risk-informed decision support** for space operations — laying the groundwork for scalable, sustainable infrastructure beyond Earth.

## 👩‍🚀 About Me

I'm a mission-focused systems architect and cybersecurity director with a deep understanding of how technical architecture, operational risk, and human resilience intersect in complex environments. From securing critical ground systems to designing long-duration mission frameworks, I translate strategy into executable, future-ready solutions — especially for domains where failure isn't an option.

My portfolio combines real-world leadership, deep technical execution, and forward-looking design thinking to support the next generation of secure, sustainable space systems.
